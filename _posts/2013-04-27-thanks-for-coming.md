We hope everyone enjoyed Thotcon 0x4 yesterday.  We had an awesome time building the badges, and are already looking forward to next year.  We'll be posting details on how to install the add-on kits next week.

Until then, if you have any comments, projects, or hacks, tell us about them by emailing us at badges@workshop88.com.
