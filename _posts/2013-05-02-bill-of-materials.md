The bill of materials for the badges is available [here](http://badge.workshop88.com/bom.pdf).  The top half are the components already installed on your badge.  The remainder are the 'Hacker Kit' that we had available at the con.  If you would like to order a kit from us, we only have a few left, so email badges@workshop88.com for info before they're gone.
