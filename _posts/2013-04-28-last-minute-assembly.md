The MCU on the badges is a [QFN package](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad-flat_no-leads_package), and when programming them, we found that a number had not reflowed correctly.

QFN is nearly impossible to inspect visually, so we had to do some hot-air rework and then try them out to verify that they worked correctly.
