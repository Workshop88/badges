BUGS:
    01-29-2013:

    -- Backwards compatibility feature with 5 volt Arduino shields not
       implemented.

    -- Compatibility with the Zigduino design is incomplete.

    02-04-2013:

    -- Use of standard via hole sizes simplifies hand assembly, but occupies
       considerable PCB real-estate. Could use micro-vias, but drill bits 
       that small are not a hobbyist item.

    -- Drive current from U1 I/O lines is 8 mA, maximum, according to the
       data sheet. The prototypes seemed to have higher drive capability than
       expected. The performance of the prototypes should not be taken as
       an indication that higher drive currents are acceptable.
        
    02-11-2013:

    -- USB "connector" on PC board only provides a source of 5 volt
       power.  The USB data lines are unterminated stubs. The stubs may
       cause problems for other high speed USB peripherals sharing a port
       with the badge.
